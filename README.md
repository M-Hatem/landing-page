## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

### Project Title

This project is all about using javascript to build a full dynamic web application.

The project has a subject of Landing webpage, which means it has a navBar that is built dynamically, it has active sections and it also has smooth scrolling feautre.


### Development

It took my full four days to start using javascript correctly, so the project may contain some beginners error's in syntax but there's no fatal errors in console which means the code is good and working correctly.


### Contribute

I maybe used some refrrence such as [IntersectionObserver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOWq3_zpOK4) video from dcode and also i read the documentation from MDN , i also used Kavin Powell channel for some tutorials such as [IntersectionObserver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8EYosX4NOo)

That's not it i also watched a video for Udacity's first project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkCG9_3tUqA) to get to know the project well, i also used this video to be a referrance for me.
